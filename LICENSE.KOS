Dreamroq is covered under the same terms as the KallistiOS license which
is copied below:


Most of the code of KallistiOS proper is currently covered under the KOS
License, which are the terms of the *new* BSD license with our names
inserted as the copyright holders and the "advertising clause" removed
entirely. In all files that state that they are part of the KallistiOS
operating system, you can assume that the following text is inserted in
the header:

*
* This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
* it under the terms of the KOS License.
*
* This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
* but WITHOUT ANY WARRANY; without even the implied warranty of
* MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
* KOS License (README.KOS) for more details.
*
* You should have received a copy of the KOS License along with this
* program; if not, please visit Cryptic Allusion DCDev at:
*
*   http://dcdev.allusion.net/
*

The text of that license follows. In layman's terms, all it really
says is that you have to give credit where credit is due (both in
derived source files and binary compilations; a credit in the
documentation is ok) and there is no warranty.
